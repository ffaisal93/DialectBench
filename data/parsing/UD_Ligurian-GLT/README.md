# Summary

The Genoese Ligurian Treebank is a small, manually annotated collection of contemporary Ligurian prose. The focus of the treebank is written Genoese, the koiné variety of Ligurian which is associated with today's literary, journalistic and academic ligurophone sphere.

# Introduction

This dataset represents the first dependency treebank of Ligurian ever collected. The materials included span several genres, and have been extracted from the most varied sources in order to reflect variation in syntax and register.

The largest source of material is the fiction domain, represented by excerpts from three novels by contemporary authors or translators. We also include a news article, a current affairs article, a passage from the Bible, two entries from the Ligurian Wikipedia, a number of example sentences from a grammar book, and the transcript of a short radio broadcast. All these documents make up the test split of the dataset. The training split consists of translations of the sentences from the [Cairo CICLing Corpus](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/cairo).

# Acknowledgments

We are deeply grateful to the publisher _De Ferrari Editore_ and the editor of the newspaper _O Stafî_ for allowing the computational use of some of their written materials for this treebank.
